# Random Variable Generator from a density function

In this repo, I prensent you a tool that can make samples from a random variable given by it's density fuunction. The density function can be whatever you want even thought i has a finite integral il the bounds you give.

I use a tree made recursively by barycentric values of the function. You can see how I do that in ```main.ipynb```.

The you can make your on gif with any function you want in ```calculator.py```. You will get a series of pictures containing the histogram plot, and you can create the gif from it online.

Enjoy your reading ;)
